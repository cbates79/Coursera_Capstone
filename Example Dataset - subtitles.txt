Hello again. Let's use
our shared data for Seattle city as an example of how to deal with
the accidents data. The same can be applied to any data set that you might
use for this capstone. To choose the right data set
for this capstone project, please go through the
following reading section called guidance in
finding a data set. Let's open the CSV file and check what type
of data we have. The first column colored in
yellow is the labeled data. The remaining columns have
different types of attributes. Some or all can be used
to train the model. You can also find that most of the observations are good to train and test the
machine learning model. The label for the
data set is severity, which describes the
fatality of an accident. You will notice that
the shared data has unbalanced labels. You should balance the data, otherwise, you will
create a biased ML model. The following is a list of attributes or features
that you can use. For good description
of each attribute, you can refer to the web
link on the CSV file. You might need to do
some feature engineering to improve the predictability
of your model. You can get the data set
from any open source, such as Open Government
Data portal, or any research groups that
allow you to use their data. Here are some good resources
that can help you find your data set and start building your machine
learning model. I recommend you go through
them carefully. Good luck.
