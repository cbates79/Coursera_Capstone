Hello everyone, and welcome to the applied data science
specialization capstone. I'm Naif, a data
scientist at IBM, and I'll be your
course instructor. Let me start by
congratulating you on making it all the
way to the capstone. By now you must have completed all the other eight courses
in this specialization, which are: what is
the data science, tools for data science, data science methodology,
Python for data science and AI, databases and SQL
for data science, data analytics with Python, data visualization with Python, and finally, machine
learning with Python. You will be expected to complete the course in three weeks. In this first week, you will discover your
project objectives, find your dataset that you will use for this capstone project, and publish your
dataset on GitHub. In the second week, you will build your machine
learning solution. In the third week,
you will finalize your model and be ready
to submit your work. Let's get started. Let me introduce the context of the capstone project
through a scenario. To complete capstone,
you will be working on a case study which is to predict the severity
of an accident. Say you are driving to another city for work or
to visit some friends. It is rainy and windy,
and on the way, you come across a
terrible traffic jam on the other side of the highway. Long lines of cars barely moving. As you keep driving, police car start appearing from afar shutting down the highway. Oh, it is an accident
and there's a helicopter transporting the ones involved in the crash to the
nearest hospital. They must be in
critical condition for all of this to be happening. Now, wouldn't it be
great if there is something in place
that could warn you, given the weather and
the road conditions about the possibility of you getting into a car accident
and how severe it would be, so that you would
drive more carefully or even change your travel
if you are able to. Well, this is exactly
what you will be working on in this course.
